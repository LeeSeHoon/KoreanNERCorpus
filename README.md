The 'original' folder is the original data set of HCLT 2016.

In 'modified' folder, there are data set with modified test set of HCLT 2016.

I modified 41 spot and mark with 'CH' sign in tag-complete sentence of 'dev_modified.txt'.

So you can use it by remove all 'CH' character or add ignoring code in your program.
